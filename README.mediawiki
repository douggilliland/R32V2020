= Land Boards - R32V2020 - 32-Bit RISC on Altera Spartan FPGAs =

* These are the files for the 32-bit RISC FPGA

= Targetting other FPGAs ==

* R32V2020 is a 32-bit RISC core specifically targeted at Altera Spartan FPGAs
* R32V2020 could be targeted to any FPGA that has sufficient Logic Elements and internal RAM blocks

== Advantages ==

* There's enough BlockRAM in a Spartan FPGA to have separate Instruction, Data and Stack Memory
* This makes CPU design much simpler since there's very little multiplexing of address/data for common busses
* See the Architecture document(s) for details

== Minimum Resource Requirements ==

* Constraints
** 32-bit data (4 of 1K Blocks in the Spartan FPGAs)
** Three address spaces (Three spaces times four blocks = 12 blocks minimum)
** The Spartan EP4 FPGA has 30 of 1KB blocks
** Peripherals can use some blocks

== Ownership ==

* We all stand on the shoulders of giants.
* The concepts in this RISC design are found in any Computer Architecture Design textbook.

== Warning ==

* Use at your own risk.
** If you brick your part or it melt to a puddle, it's on you not me.
