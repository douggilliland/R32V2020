= Land Boards - R32V2020 - 32-Bit RISC on the EP4 FPGA =

* These are the files for the 32-bit RISC FPGA

= Targetting other FPGAs ==

* R32V2020 is a 32-bit RISC core specifically targetted for Altera Spartan FPGA
* R32V2020 could be targeted to any FPGA that has sufficient Logic Elements and internal RAM blocks

== Ownership ==

* We all stand on the shoulders of giants.
* The concepts in this RISC design are found in any Computer Architecture Design textbook.

== Warning ==

* Use at your own risk.
** If you brick your part or it melt to a puddle, it's on you not me.
