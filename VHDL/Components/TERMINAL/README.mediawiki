== Multicomp FPGA (VHDL Template) VGA ==

These files are from [https://github.com/nealcrook/multicomp6809/tree/master/multicomp/Components/TERMINAL Neal Crook's port of the VHDL code to support VGA files] (as snagged 2019-04-08) for [http://searle.hostei.com/grant/Multicomp/index.html Grant Searle's Multicomp] Retro-Computer. [https://github.com/nealcrook/multicomp6809/wiki/VDU-Modifications Neal describes the enhancements here].

Grant's projects re-create late 1970's and early 1980's era vintage computers using inexpensive FPGA cards. The various parts that make up retro-computers are in each of the folders.

Our [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=RetroComputing RetroComputing Wiki page is here].

== Ownership ==

* Some of these files such as FPGA designs and software libraries were created by others.
** There may be newer versions of these libraries "out there".
** Some libraries even have the same names but don't work the same.
* Many of these files were created by me based on the work of others.

=== Warning ===

* Use at your own risk.
** If you brick your part or it melt to a puddle, it's on you not me.
