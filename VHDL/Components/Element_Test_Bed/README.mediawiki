These files are [http://searle.hostei.com/grant/Multicomp/index.html Grant Searle's Multicomp] Retro-Computer targeted for the UK101. Grant's project re-creates late 1970's and early 1980's era vintage computers using an inexpensive Altera Cyclone II EP2 FPGA card. The various builds that make up different vintage retro-computers are in each of the folders. This page ports that implementation to a commercial board which has hardware resources built into the card. This particular computer was known as the BBC Computer (the beeb by fans) and in the US as the Ohio Scientific SuperBoard II or C1P.

Grant's UK101 code uses composite video out. The board does not have a composite video out but it does route the VGA digital lines to the I/O connector so a composite video out can be produced with an RCA connector and two resistors. The I/O connector pinout is:

Alternately, the resistor chain on the VGA connector could be manipulated to do the voltage summing that is required for Composite video output.

This particular implementation enhances the original video to be 64 columns by 32 rows. Grant [http://searle.hostei.com/grant/uk101FPGA/index.html#Modification3 details this change on his page]. 

I tried this mod but it doesn't work well for NTSC video (US Standard) since it was designed around the frames for PAL encoded video. This is because the number of active lines on the display is higher but with less frames per second on PAL than NTSC. NTSC has a total of 525 lines of video at 60 Hz and PAL has a total of 625 lines of video at 50 Hz.

[https://www.diffen.com/difference/NTSC_vs_PAL PAL also has a higher bandwidth (5 MHz) than NTSC (4.2 MHz).]
