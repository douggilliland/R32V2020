-- Master State Machine for the R32V2020 CPU
-- State Machine implements a 6-bit, 1 hot state machine
-- Uses a three-bit gray-code counter which is decoded for states
-- States are 0>1>3>7>5>4
-- clr resets the state machine and holds it in clear
-- One-Hot-State bits are used as clock enables for the pipeline stages
